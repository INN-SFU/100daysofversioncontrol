This is the central station for tracking progress on the 100 days of version control challenge. We want to use a repository because that's the most transparent way of doing it, and because you can get a few points just by contributing here 😂

### Rules

#### Challenges 🏁

We have a set of challenges for you to complete. Each of them will have a specific issue, and to register that you have completed a challenge, you will comment on it including the proof of completion (a link to an issue on your repository, a screenshot, a link to a document, etc.).

The challenge issues will have the tag "challenge", and you can use this to filter only the challenge issues on the issues page.

#### Prizes contest 🏆

Each prize will also have its specific issue, tagged as "contest". To submit an entry, comment on the corresponding issue with links and screenshots. Participants will be able to upvote or downvote your submission using the reactions feature, and this may or may not be a factor for you to win.

#### Changelog ✍️

To track if you're actually controlling your versions every day for 100 days, you'll need to record your contributions to a changelog. To do that, follow these steps:
1. Create a branch from the main branch and name it CHANGELOG/YourName.
2. Edit the CHANGELOG.md file. This is a simple text file that you can edit using a plain text editor. There, log your contribution following the example in the file, describing what you did and linking the relevant contribution (a commit, a PR, an issue, etc.)
3. Commit and push your changes to your own branch.

That's it! If you have any questions, open an issue and add the tag "question" to it.

# GOOD LUCK!
